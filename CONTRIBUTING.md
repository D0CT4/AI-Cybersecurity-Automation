## Getting Started

### Finding Issues to Work On

We use GitHub issues to track work. Here's how to find something to work on:

1. **Good First Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are specially curated for new contributors
2. **Help Wanted**: Issues labeled `help wanted` are ready for community contributions
3. **Bug Reports**: Check issues labeled `bug` if you want to fix existing problems
4. **Feature Requests**: Look for `enhancement` labels if you want to implement new features

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Make sure the issue you want to work on hasn't already been assigned or is being worked on
2. **Comment on the issue**: Let us know you're interested in working on it to avoid duplicate efforts
3. **Ask questions**: If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask questions in the issue comments

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account

   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
