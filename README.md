## Automated Alerting System Architecture

The Automated Alerting System is designed to provide real-time detection, notification, and management of cybersecurity threats for SMBs and startups. The system is modular, extensible, and easy to deploy.

### Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│  Data/Event │ ──▶ │ Alert Engine│ ──▶ │ Notification│ ──▶ │ Dashboard UI │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

- **Alert Engine**: Central logic for evaluating incoming events against configurable alert rules (`config/alerts.json`).
- **Notification System**: Sends outbound notifications via email (`notifications/mailer.js`) and webhooks (`notifications/webhook.js`).
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for alert management (`routes/api.js`).
- **Dashboard UI**: React-based frontend for monitoring and managing alerts (`frontend/dashboard.jsx`).

### Key Features

- Configurable alert rules with severity, conditions, and notification settings
- Real-time alert evaluation and storage
- REST API for alert retrieval, creation, and updates
- Email and webhook notifications for new alerts
- Interactive dashboard for alert management (resolve, acknowledge, ignore)

## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install express nodemailer node-fetch react
```

### 2. Configure Alert Rules

Edit `config/alerts.json` to define custom alert rules, severity levels, and notification preferences.

### 3. Set Up Notification Settings

- **Email**: Set SMTP credentials via environment variables:
	- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `ALERT_FROM`, `ALERT_TO`
- **Webhook**: Set webhook endpoint via `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

### 4. Start the Backend Server

Create an Express app and mount the API routes:

```js
const express = require('express');
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/api');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api', apiRoutes);
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 5. Launch the Frontend Dashboard

Integrate `frontend/dashboard.jsx` into your React app. The dashboard will fetch and display alerts, allowing you to resolve, acknowledge, or ignore them.

### 6. Trigger Alerts

Alerts are triggered automatically based on incoming events and configured rules. You can also manually add alerts via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/alerts -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"message":"Test alert","severity":"high"}'
```

### 7. Manage Alerts

- View all alerts: `GET /api/alerts`
- Update alert status: `PATCH /api/alerts/:id`
